---------------------------------------------
"Database_Drill.py" was created to extract PDF
reports from the fracfocusdata.org database.

---------------------------------------------

The Database Drill was not intended to regularly
download available data from Frac Focus, but was
instead created to perform a one-time full download
of the available PDF reports.

The program was run with the following:
- Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite)
- Python 2.7.9
- Selenium [Python] (2.44)
- Watchdog [Python] (0.8.2)
- Tor Browser (4.0.3)
- FireFox Browser (35.0)

Additional nuances:
- Sleep/Screensaver disabled
- Harddrive sleep disabled

Overall, it is not guaranteed or likely that this
will work or run for anyone other than the primary
author. If further downloads from Frac Focus are
required, contact Patrick at pjsheehan@cmu.edu
